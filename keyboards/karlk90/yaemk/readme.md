![YAEMK](https://karlk90.github.io/yaemk-split-kb/images/1_yaemk_wide.webp)

- Split-Keyboard with 5 rows by 8 columns matrix with columnar stagger. Key
  layout testers for print (A4 and Letter) available!
- All 64 to 66 Keys are MX-compatible and hot-swapable.
- The thumb-cluster is configurable in 4 different configurations, just solder
  the hot-swap sockets to your needs. 4x1u, 2x2u, 2u+2x1u or 2x1u+2u
  configuration possible. Inspired by the marvelous Kyria from Thomas Baart!
- On-board ARM microcontroller (STM32F303CCT6) or RISC-V microcontroller
  (GD32VF103CBT6) **Worlds first RISC-V (Split-)Keyboard!**
- Fully supported by QMK Firmware
- Per-Key RGB back lighting with 66 easy to solder SK6812-mini-e LEDs
- Underglow RGB with 14 SMD SK6812-mini LEDs
- USB-C Hot-plugable sockets for USB connection, and split communication between
  the halves
